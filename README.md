# DeFi Staking App Starter

This project is a starter template for building a decentralized finance (DeFi) staking application. It provides the basic structure and components needed to create a staking platform where users can stake their tokens and earn rewards.

## Features

- **Token Staking**: Users can stake their tokens and earn rewards over time.
- **Reward Calculation**: Automatically calculates rewards based on the staked amount and duration.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Interacts with Ethereum smart contracts for staking and rewards.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- Truffle or Hardhat (for smart contract development)
- MetaMask (for interacting with the dApp)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Obiajulu-gif/defi-staking-app-starter.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd defi-staking-app-starter
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
    or
  

### Running the Application

1. Start the local development server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    or
    ```sh
    yarn start
    ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Deploying Smart Contracts

1. Compile the smart contracts:
    ```sh
    truffle compile
    ```
    or
    ```sh
    npx hardhat compile
    ```
2. Deploy the smart contracts to a local blockchain:
    ```sh
    truffle migrate
    ```
    or
    ```sh
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
    ```
